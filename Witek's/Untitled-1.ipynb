    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule synthesis is a fundamental aspect of chemistry, playing a particularly central role in organic chemistry. However, alongside the valuable compounds produced, chemical processes often generate significant amounts of waste. Among the various contributors to this waste, solvents play a particularly important role. They are widely used to dissolve reagents, regulate reaction temperatures, and assist in purification steps. Unfortunately, many of these solvents are volatile, toxic, and difficult to recycle. In fact, solvents can represent up to 90% of the total mass used in a typical chemical process, making their careful selection a critical concern in sustainable chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of green chemistry was introduced in the 1990s. Green chemistry focuses on designing products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. Beyond reducing environmental impact, it also aims to improve process efficiency, lower operational costs, and enhance safety for both people and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation behind this project is to reduce the environmental footprint of chemical synthesis by identifying greener solvent alternatives, provide a user-friendly tool for chemists to integrate sustainability into their workflows and finally promote green chemistry principles in both academic and industrial settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these goals, our package RetroGSF (Retrosynthesis Green Solvents Finder) was developed. This tool identifies possible synthetic pathways for a given target molecule using the retrosynthetic algorithm AiZynthFinder. It then determines the most likely solvent traditionally used for each reaction step and proposes alternative greener solvents based on their impact on human health, environmental safety, and overall sustainability. The aim is to encourage more environmentally responsible decision-making in organic synthesis by offering practical and data-driven alternatives.\n",

    "## Functionalities of the package\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Retrosynthetic Pathway Identification\n",
    "The retrosynthetic pathway is done using the AiZynthFinder library. AiZynthFinder generates possible synthetic routes for a target molecule by analyzing reaction rules and databases. The tool identifies potential pathways and ranks them based on feasibility and other criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function __retrosynthesis_reaction_smiles__ is designed to perform retrosynthesis for a given target molecule (in SMILES format) and return a table of one-step reactions in forward order. This table includes details such as reactants, products, reaction SMILES and how likely they are to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use the function:\n",
    "- __Input__ : Provide the target molecule in SMILES format and the    path to the AiZynthFinder configuration file (config.yml).\n",
    "- __Output__ :The function returns a pandas DataFrame containing the retrosynthetic steps, including reactants, products, and reaction SMILES.\n",

The ranking is performed using physical properties (e.g., density, dielectric constant, dipole moment, refractive index) and safety/environmental criteria.
